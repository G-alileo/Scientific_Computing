# Arithmetic Sequence Generator

This Python script generates an arithmetic sequence using a starting value, a common difference, and a defined number of terms. The sequence is printed in a single line enclosed within square brackets.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

An **arithmetic sequence** is a list of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. This script allows you to define:

- The **first term** (`start`)
- The **common difference** (`difference`)
- The **number of terms** (`terms`)

### Example Output

For the given values:
- `start = 5`
- `difference = 3`
- `terms = 8`

The output will be:

- [ 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 ]
